This is a Tetris that can be run in a web browser.

I developed it for the following purposes, in addition to simply liking Tetris.

- Study of development environment VScode, git, github 
- Study of js (basic syntax, feasibility, ease of implementation, processing speed) 
- Study of algorithms 
- Evaluation of generated AI 

Furthermore, by developing a program that can define even detailed behavior, one of the purposes is to study what is interesting and pleasing about Tetris. One of the objectives is to study what is interesting and pleasing about Tetris by developing a program that can define even detailed actions.

In particular, we could not have proceeded with this project without the generated AI.
